Our client commisioned us to create the branding and the website for Kardias Luxury Suites, that should serve as a booking engine and a reservation system, whilst showcasing all available rooms and providing essential information for the guests.

On July 2023, our client requested a revamp for the website. We identified some pain-points in the design, such as color contrast and accessibility, and we updated some components and tools we used for the project.

## The first step is always about clearly defining the requirements.

I start by answering three questions:

- **What is needed?**
- **What is the wanted outcome?**
- **When should this be completed?**

In this project, we needed Kardias brand and a website to accept reservations and showcase suites, aiming to increase bookings and enhance guest satisfaction. An essential consideration was ensuring compatibility with booking.com to reduce double reservations.

## My role + team structure

The team consisted of three members:

- a **graphic designer** and **ui developer** (me)
- a front-end developer and
- a full-stack developer.

My responsibilities included creating the brand and logo, designing the UI/UX of the website, and assisting with the front-end processes. With my technical knowledge of CSS and HTML, I played a key role in translating the UI designs into functional code, particularly for the complex components and pages.

Beyond our technical roles, all team members maintained open lines of communication with the client. We organized daily meetings within the team to discuss and provide feedback on crucial aspects, including design and coding decisions.

## The standard process we follow

### Researching guests needs, booking user flow and competitors

My primary objective was to establish a user experience (UX) that felt familiar and intuitive, particularly in the context of booking a suite. To achieve this, my first step involved extensive research into popular OTAs (booking.com, airbnb etc.). I delved into their platforms to understand their user flows when it came to the booking process. By studying what worked well for others, we could refine our own approach and create a seamless booking experience for our guests. This research-driven foundation guided our decisions as we crafted the user interface and streamlined the booking engine.

### Planning the project milestones

The project was structured into three distinct sections. The first phase focused on establishing the brand identity, the second on creating a static site that exclusively presented information about the suites, and the third centered around developing the reservation system and enabling booking acceptance. We set a strict timeline of two months for the entire project, and I am pleased to report that we successfully delivered it on time.

We streamlined our tasks and sprints using GitHub projects and issues. Each team member took ownership of their tasks, consistently updating their progress and communicating their ongoing work. This method ensured transparency and facilitated effective collaboration throughout the project.

### Milestone #1: Kardias brand identity and logo design

It's important to start with a clear brand identity before diving into design work. This was the very first thing I tackled. By establishing a strong brand, we ensured that everything we designed later on would fit together nicely.

#### Exploring and sketching ideas

When coming up with ideas, the client let me be creative. I looked at the fancy rooms in Kardias for inspiration and aimed for a luxurious feel in the design. While luxury was the main idea, I also tried out different styles to see what the client liked best. This open-minded approach helped me blend different ideas, making sure the design not only met the client's needs but also matched the project's goals.

I spent a lot of time searching for a compelling story to incorporate into the logo, one that truly represented Kardias' objectives and values. A significant inspiration for the design came from Ancient Greece, particularly the concept of "xenios dias," which played a key role in shaping the creative direction.

#### Weekly logo concept presentations

I had regular weekly discussions with the client to stay aligned with their vision. The entire brand creation process spanned three weeks. During each of these weeks, I presented various logo concepts to the client. These presentations were crucial in guiding our direction moving forward. You can see them below:

- [**Presentation 1**](assets/projects/kardias/presentations/presentation-1.pdf)
- [**Presentation 2**](assets/projects/kardias/presentations/presentation-2.pdf)
- [**Presentation 3**](assets/projects/kardias/presentations/presentation-3.pdf)

#### Finalization

Following the last presentation, we reached a consensus on the pearl logo. I then meticulously refined and polished the design, ensuring every detail was perfect. I carefully exported the logo in various shapes and formats, and promptly delivered the finalized version to the client.

#### Design elements and color palette

The mark embodies a hand-drawn style with a minimalist touch, exuding an air of luxury. This aesthetic, combined with the custom-made calligraphy font, creates a visually rich and sophisticated brand identity.

The color scheme further enhances the brand's elegance. The primary color, blue, is complemented by a secondary bronze-gold tone reminiscent of jewelry. These colors were carefully selected, drawing inspiration directly from the room designs. This thoughtful choice not only ensured a seamless integration with the existing room aesthetics but also proved to be a cost-effective and time-saving solution for the renovation process.

#### Symbolism and meaning

The name "Kardias," meaning "Heart" in English, forms the essence of our brand identity. Our logo, a pearl with a heart at its center, carries profound symbolism.

This design draws inspiration from the concept of "tessera hospitalis" in ancient Greece, where "Xenia" represented hospitality and moral obligation towards foreigners. The "tessera hospitalis" was a token shared between host and guest, symbolizing their bond. Our representation of this token as a pearl emphasizes the significant value of this bond. In ancient Greece, pearls were dedicated to Aphrodite, the goddess of love, further enriching the symbolism and underscoring the profound emotional connection.

### Milestone #2 && #3: Creating the website

#### Designing the UI/UX of the site

I follow a systematic design process to maintain efficiency and consistency throughout the project. Here's a breakdown of my approach:

#### Ideating, sketching and wireframing

My design journey begins with thorough research and inspiration gathering, examining successful websites on platforms like Dribbble and Behance. This research phase helps me understand effective design decisions employed by others. Next, I translate these insights into quick sketches, exploring various ideas and solutions.

To define the project's aesthetic direction, I create a moodboard, curating visual elements that align with the desired style. During the sketching phase, I ensure responsiveness by developing two versions: one for desktop and another for mobile. This approach guarantees that my ideas are not only creative but also functional across all screen sizes. By validating responsiveness at this stage, I lay a strong foundation for the design, ensuring a seamless user experience on different devices.

#### Prototyping and Design System Development

Following the wireframing phase, I transition into creating lo-fi prototypes in Figma. During this process, I capture the promising ideas from the wireframes, transforming them into functional prototypes. Concurrently, I begin establishing design rules and guidelines, forming the basis of the design system. These guidelines ensure consistency and coherence across the entire project.

Additionally, I focus on creating fundamental design components such as typefaces, buttons, color palettes, and breakpoints. These elements serve as the building blocks of the user interface, guaranteeing a unified and visually appealing experience. By systematically developing the design system alongside the prototypes, I establish a strong foundation for the project's visual identity and user interactions.

This process continues until the prototypes reach their final, functional state.

#### Discussion, testing and iteration

We talk a lot about the final designs with both the team and the client. We test to make sure people find the website easy to use and that it looks the same everywhere. We keep making changes until everything works just right. Doing this now saves us time and confusion later when we start building the website.

#### Creating, Exporting, and Optimizing Assets

After finalizing the design, I created all the necessary assets such as icons and images. I followed a standard procedure to optimize the assets for web use:

1. **Imported Assets**: Gathered all required design elements.
2. **Exported to PNG**: Saved assets in multiple dimensions suitable for various screen sizes.
3. **Converted to WebP**: Transformed images into WebP format, offering high quality and smaller file sizes.
4. **Compression**: Compressed images further using tools like TinyPNG to reduce file sizes.

Following this method ensured that the website's assets were lightweight and loaded quickly, enhancing user experience and improving SEO performance. Additionally, I crafted the iconography and illustrations using Adobe Illustrator, adding a touch of uniqueness to the visual elements.

#### Developing the site

##### Tools we used

In the development phase, we opted for industry-standard tools to guarantee scalability for future updates and easy maintenance. Our choices were driven by a focus on simplicity and efficiency:

> **Front-End**  
> _Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind_

> **Back-End**  
> _Node.js, MariaDB_

These tools not only align with industry standards but also empower us to create a robust, scalable, and maintainable website, providing an optimal experience for both users and developers.

##### Implementing the design

My main focus was translating the design system into functional code. To begin, I converted the design system components into code, establishing the foundational elements such as typefaces, colors, and variables. Some of these were declared in the Tailwind CSS configuration for consistency.

Following this, I proceeded to work on individual pages. For pages with intricate layouts that required a deep understanding of grids and design principles, I took the lead in structuring them. My goal was to ensure these layouts aligned precisely with the prototypes, maintaining fidelity to the original design vision. This meticulous attention to detail was essential in bringing the envisioned user interface to life.

## Overcoming challenges

- **Synchronization with booking.com**

  Integrating our system with booking.com posed a significant challenge. Ensuring seamless communication between our booking engine and booking.com was crucial to avoid issues like double bookings, which could lead to guest dissatisfaction and a compromised user experience.

  Initially, a channel manager was suggested as a solution to synchronize all Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) and our site. Unfortunately, this option was not viable due to the lack of API support for custom websites.

  To address this, we implemented a workaround by syncing our calendars (iCal) with booking.com calendars through a "sync third party calendars with booking.com" feature. This real-time data exchange minimized the risk of double bookings and manual errors. Proactively addressing this challenge not only enhanced guest satisfaction but also streamlined the reservation process, ensuring a hassle-free experience for both guests and administrators.

2. **Improved Communication with Clients**: Strengthened communication skills were crucial in understanding client expectations and providing satisfactory solutions.
3. **Balancing Client Requirements and User Needs**: Striking a balance between client demands and user preferences was essential for creating a successful product.
4. **Enhanced Project Planning**: Improved project planning ensured smooth workflow and timely delivery of milestones.
5. **Expanded SEO Knowledge**: Acquiring knowledge and expertise in SEO strategies was instrumental in optimizing the website's visibility and reach.
