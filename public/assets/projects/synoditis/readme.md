We noticed a need in the Greek market for affordable transportation options. To address this gap, we developed a carpooling platform. Our goal was to help people share rides, saving money on gas and transportation costs. We started by creating an Android app, soon to be followed by a web version, ensuring accessibility for everyone, regardless of the device they use.

## Our process

### Market Research: Understanding User Needs

We conducted thorough market research, analyzing existing carpooling platforms and user behaviors. This included studying a prominent Facebook group with 60K active members, providing invaluable insights into the needs of the carpooling community in Greece.

### Exploration Ideation: Shaping the Vision

With a deep understanding of user needs, we brainstormed innovative ideas to enhance the carpooling experience. Simultaneously, we developed a robust business model, aiming for sustainability and investor appeal.

### Planning and Milestones: Structured Development

We structured our development process into milestones:

1. **Milestone #1: Whitepaper** A detailed document outlining project specifications, methodologies, and goals, acting as our guiding framework.
2. **Milestone #2: Branding** Creation of a strong and cohesive brand identity, incorporating symbolism representing both drivers and passengers.
3. **Milestone #3: Business Model and Pitch Deck** Development of presentations outlining our business strategy and attracting potential investors.
4. **Milestone #4: Android App Development** Creating the Android application, focusing on user-friendly design and functionality.
5. **Milestone #5: Web App Development** Building the web application to ensure accessibility across all devices.

### Milestone #1: Whitepaper

In this phase we were free to shape our idea and its future. It was important to establishe our product and its core ideas, as well as, provide information about our methodology on how we would approach the project. This acted as a guide on wherewe were going and reminded us the purpose of developing the project, every time we accidentally introduced scope creep. And finally it was great for showcasing our plans to others people that wanted to learn more about us and synoditis.

### Milestone #2: Branding

It's important to start with a clear brand identity before diving into design work. This was the very first thing I tackled. By establishing a strong brand, we ensured that everything we designed later on would fit together nicely.

#### Exploring and sketching ideas

I wanted to play with the letter f for the mark, but i didnt only want the mark to be a letter. I tried incorporating abstract ideas into the the f mark. I also started experimenting with some symbolism in the carpooling community, specifically with the thumbs up.

#### Design elements and color palette

The mark embodies a minimalist style, that feels bold and modern.

The color scheme further enhances the symbolism. We have assgined a red-orange color to the passengers, because they are more energetic and are searching for a trip, and the drivers with the deep green, that feels relaxed and is an act of sharing.

#### Symbolism and meaning

The name "Synoditis," meaning "Fellow Traveller" in English, which was our first namee, forms the essence of our brand identity.

The mark, along with the colros, symbolizes the two different categories of users our platform has that intersect and cooperate, the driversd and the passengers.

### Milestone #3: Business Model + Pitch Deck

#### Business Model Development

In this phase, we meticulously crafted a robust and sustainable business model. We analyzed revenue streams, cost structures, and market positioning, ensuring Synoditis could thrive in the competitive carpooling landscape. Our model prioritized fair pricing for both drivers and passengers, fostering a balance between affordability and profitability.

#### Pitch Deck Creation

Simultaneously, we developed a compelling pitch deck. This document succinctly communicated our vision, outlining the problem we aimed to solve, our unique value proposition, market analysis, and revenue projections. The pitch deck became a powerful tool for engaging potential investors, showcasing the viability and potential of Synoditis.

### Milestone #4: Android app

#### Design: User-Centric Interface

The design phase focused on creating an intuitive and visually appealing user interface. We prioritized user experience, ensuring seamless navigation and efficient task flows. From onboarding to ride booking, every interaction was meticulously designed to enhance user satisfaction and trust.

#### Development: Building a Stable Foundation

Our development team brought the design to life, coding the Android app from the ground up. Utilizing cutting-edge technologies, we developed a stable and responsive application. Emphasizing clean code and optimized performance, the app was crafted to function seamlessly on a wide range of Android devices.

#### MVP (Minimum Viable Product): Balancing Features and Simplicity

The MVP stage marked a crucial point in our development process. We identified essential features that formed the core of Synoditis, ensuring a minimal yet fully functional app. This strategic approach allowed us to launch quickly while maintaining the integrity of the user experience.

#### Iterations and Testing: Refinement through Feedback

Through rigorous testing and user feedback, we iteratively refined the app. Bugs were addressed promptly, and user suggestions were carefully evaluated. Continuous testing ensured a stable and reliable platform, building confidence among our users and stakeholders.

#### Release: Launching Synoditis to the World

With a polished Android app in hand, we confidently launched Synoditis to the public. The culmination of meticulous planning, design, and development, the app was now available for download, marking a significant milestone in our journey to revolutionize carpooling in Greece.

### Milestone #5: Web app

We repeated the same process for the web app.

### Promoting through Social Media

Utilizing the power of social media, we implemented a comprehensive promotional strategy. Engaging content, including success stories, driver and passenger testimonials, and promotional offers, was shared across various platforms. Targeted advertising reached potential users, creating awareness about Synoditis and its benefits. Social media interactions facilitated direct communication with our community, fostering trust and transparency.
