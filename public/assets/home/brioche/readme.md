## The first step is always about clearly defining the requirements.

I start by answering three questions:

- **What is needed?**
- **What is the wanted outcome?**
- **When should this be completed?**

In this project, we needed Brioche's brand and a website to accept orders and showcase menu items, aiming to increase sales and enhance customer satisfaction. An essential consideration was ensuring compatibility with various payment gateways to facilitate smooth transactions.

## My role + team structure

The team consisted of two members:

- a **graphic designer** and **front-end developer** (me)
- a full-stack developer.

My responsibilities included creating the brand and logo, designing the UI/UX of the website, and assisting with the front-end processes. With my technical knowledge of CSS and HTML, I played a key role in translating the UI designs into functional code, particularly for the complex components and pages.

Beyond our technical roles, all team members maintained open lines of communication with the client. We organized daily meetings within the team to discuss and provide feedback on crucial aspects, including design and coding decisions.

## The standard process we follow

### Researching guests needs, booking user flow and competitors

My primary objective was to establish a user experience (UX) that felt familiar and intuitive, particularly in the context of placing a food order. To achieve this, my first step involved extensive research into popular food delivery platforms. I delved into their interfaces to understand their user flows when it came to the order placement process. By studying what worked well for others, we could refine our own approach and create a seamless ordering experience for our customers. This research-driven foundation guided our decisions as we crafted the user interface and streamlined the ordering system.

### Planning the project milestones

The project was structured into three distinct sections. The first phase focused on establishing the brand identity, the second on creating a static site that exclusively presented information about the menu items, and the third centered around developing the order system and enabling payment acceptance. We set a strict timeline of two months for the entire project, and I am pleased to report that we successfully delivered it on time.

We streamlined our tasks and sprints using GitHub projects and issues. Each team member took ownership of their tasks, consistently updating their progress and communicating their ongoing work. This method ensured transparency and facilitated effective collaboration throughout the project.

### Milestone #1: Brioche brand identity and logo design

It's important to start with a clear brand identity before diving into design work. This was the very first thing I tackled. By establishing a strong brand, we ensured that everything we designed later on would fit together nicely.

#### Exploring and sketching ideas

When coming up with ideas, the client let me be creative. I looked at the delicious items on Brioche's menu for inspiration and aimed for a delightful feel in the design. While delight was the main idea, I also tried out different styles to see what the client liked best. This open-minded approach helped me blend different ideas, making sure the design not only met the client's needs but also matched the project's goals.

I spent a lot of time searching for a compelling story to incorporate into the logo, one that truly represented Brioche's objectives and values. A significant inspiration for the design came from the joy of savoring freshly baked goods, which played a key role in shaping the creative direction.

#### Weekly logo concept presentations

I had regular weekly discussions with the client to stay aligned with their vision. The entire brand creation process spanned three weeks. During each of these weeks, I presented various logo concepts to the client. These presentations were crucial in guiding our direction moving forward.

#### Finalization

Following the last presentation, we reached a consensus on the cheerful cupcake logo. I then meticulously refined and polished the design, ensuring every detail was perfect. I carefully exported the logo in various shapes and formats and promptly delivered the finalized version to the client.

#### Design elements and color palette

The mark embodies a hand-drawn style with a playful touch, exuding an air of delight. This aesthetic, combined with the custom-made calligraphy font, creates a visually rich and inviting brand identity.

The color scheme further enhances the brand's cheerfulness. The primary color, pastel pink, is complemented by a secondary warm yellow tone reminiscent of the sun. These colors were carefully selected, drawing inspiration directly from the menu items. This thoughtful choice not only ensured a seamless integration with the existing food aesthetics but also proved to be a visually appealing and appetizing solution for the Brioche brand.

#### Symbolism and meaning

The name "Brioche" represents the joy of indulging in delightful treats. Our logo, a cupcake with a smiling face, carries a sense of warmth and happiness.

This design draws inspiration from the happiness of enjoying freshly baked goods. The cupcake symbolizes the core essence of Brioche, representing the joy and satisfaction that their delicious offerings bring to customers. The smiling face signifies the delightful experience customers can expect, reinforcing the brand's commitment to delivering happiness with every order.

### Milestone #2 && #3: Creating the website

#### Designing the UI/UX of the site

I follow a systematic design process to maintain efficiency and consistency throughout the project. Here's a breakdown of my approach:

#### Ideating, sketching and wireframing

My design journey begins with thorough research and inspiration gathering, examining successful websites on platforms like Dribbble and Behance. This research phase helps me understand effective design decisions employed by others. Next, I translate these insights into quick sketches, exploring various ideas and solutions.

To define the project's aesthetic direction, I create a moodboard, curating visual elements that align with the desired style. During the sketching phase, I ensure responsiveness by developing two versions: one for desktop and another for mobile. This approach guarantees that my ideas are not only creative but also functional across all screen sizes. By validating responsiveness at this stage, I lay a strong foundation for the design, ensuring a delightful user experience on different devices.

#### Prototyping and Design System Development

Following the wireframing phase, I transition into creating lo-fi prototypes in Figma. During this process, I capture the promising ideas from the wireframes, transforming them into functional prototypes. Concurrently, I begin establishing design rules and guidelines, forming the basis of the design system. These guidelines ensure consistency and coherence across the entire project.

Additionally, I focus on creating fundamental design components such as typefaces, buttons, color palettes, and breakpoints. These elements serve as the building blocks of the user interface, guaranteeing a unified and visually appealing experience. By systematically developing the design system alongside the prototypes, I establish a strong foundation for the project's visual identity and user interactions.

This process continues until the prototypes reach their final, delightful state.

#### Discussion, testing and iteration

We talk a lot about the final designs with both the team and the client. We test to make sure people find the website easy to use and that it looks the same everywhere. We keep making changes until everything works just right. Doing this now saves us time and confusion later when we start building the website.

#### Creating, Exporting, and Optimizing Assets

After finalizing the design, I created all the necessary assets such as icons and images. I followed a standard procedure to optimize the assets for web use:

1. **Imported Assets**: Gathered all required design elements.
2. **Exported to PNG**: Saved assets in multiple dimensions suitable for various screen sizes.
3. **Converted to WebP**: Transformed images into WebP format, offering high quality and smaller file sizes.
4. **Compression**: Compressed images further using tools like TinyPNG to reduce file sizes.

Following this method ensured that the website's assets were lightweight and loaded quickly, enhancing user experience and improving SEO performance. Additionally, I crafted the iconography and illustrations using Adobe Illustrator, adding a touch of uniqueness to the visual elements.

#### Developing the site

##### Tools we used

In the development phase, we opted for industry-standard tools to guarantee scalability for future updates and easy maintenance. Our choices were driven by a focus on simplicity and efficiency:

> **Front-End**  
> _Thymleaf, htmx, HTML/CSS, JS_

> **Back-End**  
> _Java, Spring, MongoDB_

These tools not only align with industry standards but also empower us to create a robust, scalable, and maintainable website, providing an optimal experience for both users and developers.

##### Implementing the design

My main focus was translating the design system into functional code. To begin, I converted the design system components into code, establishing the foundational elements such as typefaces, colors, and variables. Some of these were declared in the Tailwind CSS configuration for consistency.

Following this, I proceeded to work on individual pages. For pages with intricate layouts that required a deep understanding of grids and design principles, I took the lead in structuring them. My goal was to ensure these layouts aligned precisely with the prototypes, maintaining fidelity to the original design vision. This meticulous attention to detail was essential in bringing the envisioned user interface to life.

## Overcoming challenges

- **Synchronization with payment gateways**

  Integrating our system with various payment gateways posed a significant challenge. Ensuring seamless communication between our ordering system and different payment platforms was crucial to avoid issues like payment failures, which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and a compromised user experience.

  Initially, a direct API integration was considered as a solution to synchronize all payment gateways and our site. Unfortunately, this option was not viable due to the complex requirements of different payment platforms.

  To address this, we implemented a workaround by utilizing a payment aggregator service. This service acted as an intermediary, consolidating payment requests and responses between our system and multiple payment gateways. By centralizing the communication through this aggregator, we ensured a streamlined and reliable payment process for customers. Proactively addressing this challenge not only enhanced customer satisfaction but also optimized the payment flow, ensuring a hassle-free experience for both customers and administrators.
